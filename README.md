# Overview

This repository contains code related to the paper "Modulation of metastable ensemble dynamics explains the inverted-U relationship between tone discriminability and arousal in auditory cortex" by L. Papadopoulos, S. Jo, K. Zumwalt, M. Wehr, S. Jaramillo, D.A. McCormick, and L. Mazzucato. A preprint of the manuscript is available here: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.04.588209.  

The `src_code/` directory contains all analysis, simulation, and plotting code, as well as additional READMEs.  

The release version of the code that was used for the analyses and figures in the paper can be found under the `v1.0.0` tag. That version of the code has also been deposited on Zenodo, and is available at `https://zenodo.org/records/17496600`.
